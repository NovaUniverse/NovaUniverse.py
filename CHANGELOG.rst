v1.0a1 - First Alpha Release (02/01/2022)
---------------------------
- "novauniverse.player()" is now "novauniverse.Player()" and same goes with "novauniverse.session()", more info in documentation. Docs: https://novauniversepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#
- Extended support down untill python 3.7. So api wrapper will support python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and above. (keep in mind python 3.10 has not tested yet but may work perfectly)
