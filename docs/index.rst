What is NovaUniverse.py?
==========================
NovaUniverse.py is a API wrapper for "Nova Universe" (minecraft event hosting group) that allows you to interface with the Nova Universe `API`_ in a fast object oriented way natively within Python. 
One of the bonuses is that it was developed by `ME`_, an admin at NovaUniverse.

‚öô *Install/Set Up:*

2. **That's It!** - *Brief Example Below*::

      from novauniverse import EventClient, Events, NovaOnlinePlayer 

      client = EventClient()

      @client.on_event(Events.CLIENT_READY)
      def client_is_ready():

      @client.on_event(Events.PLAYER_JOIN)

Some quick short examples to get started with NovaUniverse.py. üåü
After you have a read here please do check out

   This is what we call interfaces. Interfaces are used to... well... **interface!** ha ha, yes... they are how you interface with the Nova Universe API.

   Getting tournament results::

      from novauniverse import NovaGames, MCF

      # Get the latest Nova Games tournament.
      nova_games = NovaGames().get_latest()

      # Prints out how much each player scored in that tournament and also how many kills they achieved.
      for player in nova_games.players:
         print(f"'{player.username}' got {player.kills} kill(s) and scored {player.score} point(s) in the Nova Games hosted on {nova_games.date.date()}.")

   Neat right üòÅ.

   Searching for a specific mcf tournament::
   
      from novauniverse import MCF, Search

      mcf = MCF().search(Search(id=17))

      for player in mcf.players:
         print(f"'{player.username}' got {player.kills} kill(s) and scored {player.score} point(s) in the MCF hosted on {mcf.date.date()}.")
